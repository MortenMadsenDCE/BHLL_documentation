## (A first version of) Background info and tools for researchers doing studies on the BHLL-cohort.

## Background:

The Better Health in Late Life population cohort was developed from respondents to an online questionnaire survey that was conducted in Denmark in late 2021 through early 2022. At that time, the total population in Denmark was 5.6 million residents, of whom 1.2 million (21%) were 50–65 years of age.

Of the original 301,244 individuals who were invited to participate, 114,555 responded (opened the questionnaire, and answered at least one question), yielding a response rate of 38%.

## content:

Below you can find some background information on the cohort that can be relevant when you plan your Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for a study on the BHLL-cohort, or if you as a statistician are going to work on the data. This includes variables etc. that have been cleaned up in previous studies and might be relevant to reuse.\

2.  List of relevant variables that have been calculated or cleaned up before and are therefore might be relevant to reuse in future studies:

    a.  About [dataset with background population of all Danes 50–65-year-old](background_population.html), to access the representativeness of the BHLL-respondents (Morten)

    b.  A dataset with major recommended SEP-variables, so they can easily be included in your study. The dataset has been prepared by Morten and Cathrine June 2025. Find [further description and documentation can be downloaded here](SEP%20on%20BHLL-population_ver5_18jun2025.docx).

    c.  Dietary score (Julie) –\>(Spring2025: Julie and Morten has been working on implementing [a dietary score for nutrition among cancer patients](Dietary_Score.html).). (Julie, Rikke and Anne Sofie are considering making a score based on the danish guidelines, but the project is on hold right now.)

    d.  Stress, depression, self-perceived health (PSS, MDI, MCS, PCS). Remember to give an official reference when using MCS or PCS. [Path to dataset and further documentation.](Scores.html)

    e.  A crude [Cancer-staging](Cancer_stage.html) for 21 main cancer types by Julie and Morten June 2025

    f.  BMI (Frederik) –\> (2024: We did a little data-cleansing of hight- and weight-data for Frederiks project on BMI and self-reported-health)

    g.  Overview of missingness of each question–\> (Apr 2025: It is planned to make a list of all BHLL variable names, labels and missingness.)

    h.  Some diseases are complicated to identify well using registries. Find here description of algorithm and path for a dataset with the values: [CKD](CKD.html), (diabetes?).

    i.  Interpreting [physical activity](Physical_activity.html)

3.  Follow up: At the moment (April 2025) we have FU (mortality, hospital visists, medication use) until the end of 2022 at the DST-projects(708194 / 709876) with our BHLL-data. We hope to get access to FU until end of 2023 within a few months (?)

## (A very first version of) Background info and tools for researchers doing studies on the BHLL-cohort.

## Background:

The Better Health in Late Life population cohort was developed from respondents to an online questionnaire survey that was conducted in Denmark in late 2021 through early 2022. At that time, the total population in Denmark was 5.6 million residents, of whom 1.2 million (21%) were 50–65 years of age.

Of the original 301,244 individuals who were invited to participate, 114,555 responded (opened the questionnaire, and answered at least one question), yielding a response rate of 38%.

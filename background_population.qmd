## Background Population

For the study BHLL - representativeness Morten has been creating a dataset with background-population.\

**Details**

The aim of the representatives study is to develop weights for the BHLL-cohort to make it more comparable with the background population, and to access this by comparing mortality in BHLL with mortality in background population.

The background population cohort (DK50_65) is selected on similar cirteria as BHLL-cohort:

-   50-65 years September 1st 2021.

-   (Resident in DK 30jun2021... Or 31dec2020 ...decide)

-   Each individual is assigned an artificial index-date (uniformly distributed throughout October and November), that makes the distribution of index-dates comparable between BHLL-cohort and background-cohort.

The BHLL-cohort is a subgroup of this DK50_65 cohort (at least if the BHLL-cohort is restricted to persons resident in DK 31dec2020 - see "Help defining study population"...).

**Usage in other BHLL-studies**\
Besides using the cohort for the specific representativeness study, it can as well be used to add a little background information for most studies. E.g. a study in quality of life among stroke-survivors, can be supplemented with a table of prevalence of stroke-survivors in the background population, their medication use, comorbidities and their mortality.

**For the statistician:**

A sas dataset of the cohort (with variables) will be accessible at the server as DK50_65 ...

Representativenes results:

The very first results from representativenes study has been presented at ICPE Aug2024. [The poster can be downloaded here.](Representativeness ICPE2024 final.pdf "Representativeness ICPE2024 final.pdf")

Julie and Morten have June 2025 made a crude cancer staging for 21 main cancer types primarily based on TNM-codes from the cancer registry. Download [a brief documentation](Cancer_TNM_algorithm ver2 20jun25.docx) including paths to SAS program using the algorithm, and a SAS-dataset with stages for prevalent cancers among BHLL-respondents.

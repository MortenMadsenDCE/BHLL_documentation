## CKD

CKD is identified through lab-measures that are taken at outpatient visits and GP-visits. So not during inpatient stay and not during emergency room visits.

This algorithm has been developed by the Kidney-group (Uffe, Christian, Simon, Anne,...) and implemented for the BHLL-data by Morten in May 2025.\

### Identifying inpatient and emergency room visits:

LPR2: All hospital contacts with either C_indm=1 or c_pattype in ('0','3')

LPR3 - Acute admissions: Are identified by ...

LPR3 - inpatient visits: When two hospital contacts are less than three hours apart (from end of contact one, to start of contact two), these are counted as the same contact. If the duration of such (potentially combined) contact is more than 12 hours, we define it as an inpatient visit.

### Selection of lab-measurements:

All lab-measurements taken on a calendar date involved in one of the inpatient visits and acute admissions are disregarded.

Lab-measurements in the period from 5 years prior to the index date until index date are selected.

Creatinine measurements are identified based on the NPU codes: {NPU01807, NPU04998, NPU17559, NPU18016} (We don't find any measurements for neither NPU01807 nor NPU17559) (*NPU09101 was requested, but is not available in this project. But Uffe doesn't find any of these in his study at SDS)* (And we include the very few *measurements of NPU18105 (0.01%). This is not standard in other CKD studies, but has been included in other BHLL-studies)*

eGFR is calculated ... (based on gender and age at time of measurement).

CKD is defined as (at least) two eGFR measuerments (whitin this 5 yr period) \<60 ml/min/1.73m^2^ separated by at least 90 days (disregarding other measurements in between)

CKD-grades: As above, except the chosen level:

-   CKD grade 5: Two measurements \<15 ml/min/1.73m^2^
-   CKD grade 4: Two measurements \<30 ml/min/1.73m^2^ and not of grade 5
-   CKD grade 3b: Two measurements \<45 ml/min/1.73m^2^ and not of grade 4 or 5
-   CKD grade 3a: Two measurements \<60 ml/min/1.73m^2^ and not of grade 3b, 4 or 5

uACR (urine albumin-creatinine ratio) - NPUcodes (proportion): NPU03918 (0%), NPU19661 (99%), NPU28842 (1%).

NPU28842 is measured in g/mol. The conversion factor to mg/g is 8.84 (mg/g)/(g/mol).

Non-numeric values: If measurements for NPU19661 (\~2%) are noted as \<x (x typicaly beneath 30, but a few above as well) they are ignored. A few measurements (approx. 30) are noted as \>y (where y is a high number larger than 800). These are kept.

uACR identified pÃ¥ two codes\>=30 mg/g, separated by at least 90 days.

### Dataset:

The dataset includes the following variables

-   pnr
-   int_dato (artificial int_dato for background population)
-   CKD as binary variable
-   CKD-grade {0, 3a, 3b, 4, 5}
-   uACR (binary)
-   CKD_or_uACR (binary)

The dataset is located as DK5065_ckd (a dated version is also available). At
